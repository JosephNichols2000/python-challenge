Module 3 challenge
In this assignment we were asked to do some analysis of the data given to us in the CSV files attached to this repository. 
For the pybank assignment we were asked to find the total months of profit loss amounts, the sum of the total profit, the changes between each date, the average change for the whole dataset, and the max and min changes in profits by date.
For the pypoll assignment we were to find the total votes, the votes per candidate, the perecentage of votes per candidate, and the winner of the election.
